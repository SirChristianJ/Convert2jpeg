# Convert2jpeg
Using Python forked image processing library (PIL). It incorporates lightweight image processing tools that aids in editing, creating and saving images. This program takes any file type related to imagery such as PNG or BMP files and converts it to a JPG file.
This is done by adding a .JPG extension to the original file name. Then convert the original image to RGB mode to preserve its color channels since a majority of electronic devices use RGB mode to conveniently produce colors onto their screens.

Save desired image as .png , .bmp, etc
